# 8ball-api
A magical API that returns answers to questions asked of it - ready to be used in conjunction with 8ball-js

Update custom/config.ini.php to restrict request origins and debugging. The code is here to play with mainly for educational purposes.

The repository github.com/chadkluck/8ball-js has the companion javascript that shows the interactive 8 Ball.
